# Problem Statement

A problem statement is a concise document that frames the problem you're solving, articulates the impact on users and the business, and defines clear success criteria. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent product work by ensuring alignment on *what* problem to solve before jumping to *how* to solve it.

## When to Use

- Starting a new initiative or project to establish shared understanding
- Realigning a drifted project back to its original intent
- Communicating up to leadership or stakeholders about priorities
- Evaluating whether a proposed solution actually addresses the core problem
- Onboarding new team members to provide context

## Instructions

When asked to create a problem statement, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the User Segment**
   Ask who is experiencing this problem. Get specific about the user persona, role, or segment. Avoid vague descriptions like "users" — instead target "mobile shoppers completing checkout" or "enterprise admins managing 50+ users."

2. **Understand the Pain Points**
   Explore what friction, frustration, or unmet need the user experiences. Ask probing questions to understand the severity and frequency of the problem. Look for evidence from user research, support tickets, or behavioral data.

3. **Establish Business Context**
   Connect the user problem to business impact. How does this problem affect revenue, retention, growth, or strategic goals? Why should the organization invest in solving this now versus later?

4. **Define Success Metrics**
   Identify how you will measure success. What metrics will move if this problem is solved? Establish current baselines and target improvements. Be specific and time-bound.

5. **Surface Constraints and Considerations**
   Note any technical limitations, resource constraints, regulatory requirements, or dependencies that will shape the solution space.

6. **Capture Open Questions**
   Document what you don't know yet. What assumptions need validation? What additional research is needed?

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Problem is specific to a defined user segment (not "all users")
- [ ] Impact is quantified with data or reasonable estimates
- [ ] Success metrics have baselines and targets
- [ ] Problem describes the "what" without prescribing the "how"
- [ ] Business context explains why this matters now
- [ ] Open questions are captured for follow-up
