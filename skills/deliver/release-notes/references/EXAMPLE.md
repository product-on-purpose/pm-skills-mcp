# TaskFlow 3.4

**Release Date:** January 14, 2026

## Highlights

### See Your Projects at a Glance with Gantt Charts

Plan and track projects visually with our new Gantt chart view. See task dependencies, identify bottlenecks, and adjust timelines by simply dragging tasks on the timeline. Whether you're managing a product launch or a construction project, Gantt charts help you keep everything on track.

### Dark Mode for Late-Night Productivity

Work comfortably in low-light environments with full dark mode support. Your eyes will thank you during those evening planning sessions. Toggle dark mode in Settings, or let it follow your system preferences automatically.

## New Features

- **Export to PDF:** Share professional project reports with stakeholders who don't use TaskFlow. Export any project view — including Gantt charts — as a formatted PDF with your company logo.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Power users, rejoice. Navigate TaskFlow without touching your mouse. Press `?` anywhere to see the full shortcut list, or use `Cmd+K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open the command palette.

- **Recurring Task Templates:** Set up tasks that repeat on a schedule — daily standups, weekly reviews, monthly reports. Create once, and TaskFlow handles the rest.

## Improvements

- **Faster Page Loads:** We've optimized how projects load, resulting in 40% faster page loads for large projects with 500+ tasks. Complex projects now feel snappy.

- **Smarter Search:** Search now includes task comments and attachments, not just task titles. Find that discussion from last month without remembering which task it was on.

- **Improved Mobile Navigation:** The bottom navigation bar now shows your most-used views first, based on your actual usage patterns. Get to what matters faster on mobile.

- **Clearer Due Date Warnings:** Tasks due today show a yellow indicator; overdue tasks show red. No more missing deadlines because they blended into the background.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where calendar sync with Outlook 365 would occasionally fail for users with many calendars. All your meetings now sync reliably.

- Fixed an issue where copying a task would not copy its attachments. Duplicated tasks now include all files.

- Fixed an issue where notification emails would sometimes arrive hours late. Notifications now deliver within minutes.

- Fixed an issue where the mobile app would crash when viewing projects with special characters in the name. International project names are now fully supported.

- Fixed an issue where undoing a task deletion would not restore the task's comments. Undo now restores everything.

## Known Issues

- Gantt chart export to PDF currently limits charts to 50 visible tasks. For larger projects, try filtering to a specific milestone before exporting. We're working on supporting larger exports.

- Dark mode does not yet apply to email notifications. This is coming in a future update.

## Coming Soon

We're putting the finishing touches on **AI-powered task suggestions** — TaskFlow will learn from your completed projects and suggest task breakdowns for new projects. Plus, **time tracking** is in beta testing and launching next month.
