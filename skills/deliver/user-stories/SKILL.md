# User Stories

User stories are concise descriptions of functionality from the user's perspective. They capture who needs something, what they need, and why — without prescribing how to build it. Good user stories enable teams to break large features into estimable, deliverable increments while maintaining focus on user value.

## When to Use

- After PRD approval, when breaking down features for implementation
- During sprint planning to create actionable work items
- When writing tickets for engineering teams
- When communicating requirements to stakeholders in accessible terms
- When prioritizing a backlog based on user value

## Instructions

When asked to create user stories, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Feature Context**
   Review the PRD or feature description. Understand the overall goal, target users, and scope boundaries. User stories should trace back to documented requirements.

2. **Identify User Personas**
   Determine which users interact with this feature. Each story should be written for a specific persona, not generic "users." Different personas may need different stories for the same feature.

3. **Break Down by User Goal**
   Decompose the feature into distinct user goals. Each story should deliver a complete, valuable capability — something the user can actually do when the story is done.

4. **Write Story Statements**
   Use the format: "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [benefit]." The benefit clause is critical — it explains why this matters and helps prioritize.

5. **Define Acceptance Criteria**
   Write specific, testable criteria using Given/When/Then format. Acceptance criteria define "done" — if all criteria pass, the story is complete.

6. **Apply INVEST Criteria**
   Validate each story against INVEST: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable. Revise stories that don't meet these criteria.

7. **Add Context and Notes**
   Include relevant design references, technical considerations, and dependencies. These help implementers understand the full picture.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Each story follows "As a... I want... so that..." format
- [ ] Stories are independent (can be built in any order)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Each criterion is testable (someone can verify pass/fail)
- [ ] Stories are small enough to complete in one sprint
- [ ] No implementation details in the story statement
- [ ] Benefit clause explains why this matters to the user

## Examples

See `references/EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example.
