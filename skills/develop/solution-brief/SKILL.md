# Solution Brief

A solution brief is a concise, one-page document that communicates the proposed solution to a problem. It serves as the bridge between problem understanding and detailed specification, providing enough context for stakeholders to align on the approach without getting lost in implementation details. The one-page constraint forces clarity and prioritization.

## When to Use

- Pitching a solution approach to stakeholders for buy-in
- Aligning cross-functional teams on what you're building and why
- Documenting solution intent before detailed PRD writing
- Comparing multiple solution options at a high level
- Communicating product direction to leadership

## Instructions

When asked to create a solution brief, follow these steps:

1. **Recap the Problem**
   Summarize the problem in 2-3 sentences maximum. Don't re-explain the full problem statement — reference it if needed. The reader should immediately understand what pain point this solution addresses.

2. **Describe the Proposed Solution**
   Explain what you're building in clear, non-technical language. Focus on the user experience and core value proposition. Avoid implementation details — this is about *what*, not *how*.

3. **List Key Features**
   Identify 3-5 essential features that comprise the solution. These should be the minimum set needed to solve the problem. Resist the urge to include nice-to-haves — the one-page constraint demands focus.

4. **Define Success Metrics**
   Connect the solution to measurable outcomes. How will you know if this works? Reference metrics from the problem statement and set targets.

5. **Acknowledge Trade-offs**
   Document what you're explicitly NOT doing and why. Good solution briefs are honest about scope limitations and alternatives that were considered but rejected.

6. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**
   Surface the biggest risks to success and your plan to address them. This builds stakeholder confidence and surfaces concerns early.

7. **Outline Next Steps**
   Provide 3-5 immediate actions to move the solution forward. Be specific about who does what.
