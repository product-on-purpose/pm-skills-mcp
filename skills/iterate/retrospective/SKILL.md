# Retrospective

A retrospective is a structured reflection that helps teams learn from their experiences and continuously improve. By regularly examining what went well, what didn't, and what to change, teams build a culture of learning and adaptation. The value isn't just in the discussion—it's in the documented actions and follow-through.

## When to Use

- At the end of every sprint (for agile teams)
- After completing a significant project or milestone
- Following a major incident or outage
- When team dynamics feel off and need addressing
- At regular intervals (monthly, quarterly) even without specific triggers
- When onboarding new team members to establish improvement culture

## Instructions

When asked to facilitate or document a retrospective, follow these steps:

1. **Set the Context**
   Define what period or project this retrospective covers, who attended, and any significant events that occurred. This frames the discussion and helps future readers understand the context.

2. **Choose a Format**
   Select a retrospective format that fits the team's needs. Common options include:
   - **Start/Stop/Continue:** Simple and direct
   - **4Ls:** Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
   - **Mad/Sad/Glad:** Emotion-focused
   - **Sailboat:** Visual metaphor (wind=helps, anchor=holds back)

3. **Gather Input**
   Collect observations from all team members. Ensure everyone contributes—quiet voices often have important insights. Group similar items to identify themes.

4. **Discuss and Prioritize**
   Don't try to address everything. Focus the discussion on the most impactful items. Vote or discuss to identify the top 2-3 issues to address.

5. **Define Action Items**
   Convert insights into specific, assignable actions. Every action needs an owner and a due date. Avoid vague improvements like "communicate better."

6. **Review Previous Actions**
   Check the status of action items from the last retrospective. Celebrate completions and discuss blockers for incomplete items. This builds accountability.

7. **Document for Future Reference**
   Capture the key points so they're available for future team members and for tracking patterns over time.
