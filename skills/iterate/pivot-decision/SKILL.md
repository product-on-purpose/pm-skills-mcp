# Pivot Decision

A pivot decision document captures the analysis and rationale behind a strategic direction change—or the decision to stay the course. Based on the Lean Startup concept of "pivot or persevere," this artifact ensures major strategic decisions are made with evidence, communicated clearly, and preserved for organizational learning.

## When to Use

- After significant validated learning suggests the current direction may not work
- At planned pivot-or-persevere checkpoints (e.g., after MVP launch)
- When key hypotheses have been invalidated by market feedback
- During strategy reviews when considering major direction changes
- When stakeholders are debating whether to change course

## Instructions

When asked to document a pivot decision, follow these steps:

1. **Summarize Current State**
   Document what you're currently doing, how long you've been doing it, what you've invested, and what results you've achieved. This grounds the decision in reality.

2. **Present the Evidence**
   Compile all relevant data: metrics, user feedback, experiment results, market signals. Be comprehensive—include evidence that supports both staying and changing course.

3. **Review Hypotheses**
   Revisit the original hypotheses that justified the current direction. Which have been validated? Which have been invalidated? Which remain untested?

4. **Define Options**
   Articulate at least three options: persevere (continue current direction), and two or more distinct pivot options. Describe each option concretely—what would change?

5. **Analyze Each Option**
   Evaluate options against key criteria: market opportunity, competitive advantage, team capability, resource requirements, and risk. Use evidence, not opinions.

6. **Make the Decision**
   State the chosen direction clearly. Explain the rationale, acknowledging trade-offs. If the team disagrees, capture dissenting views.

7. **Plan Implementation**
   Outline what happens next: immediate actions, resource needs, success criteria for the new direction, and communication plan.
