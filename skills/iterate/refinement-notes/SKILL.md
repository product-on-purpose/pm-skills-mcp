# Refinement Notes

Refinement notes capture the outcomes of backlog refinement (grooming) sessions—what was discussed, what was estimated, and what decisions were made. They serve as a quick reference for team members who missed the session and a historical record of how stories evolved from idea to ready-for-sprint.

## When to Use

- During refinement sessions to capture decisions in real-time
- After refinement to share outcomes with absent team members
- When onboarding new team members to explain backlog context
- Before sprint planning to review what's been refined
- When stories need re-refinement due to time elapsed

## Instructions

When asked to document refinement notes, follow these steps:

1. **Record Session Metadata**
   Note the date, attendees, and duration. This helps track who was part of decisions and when discussions happened.

2. **List Stories Discussed**
   For each story, capture the outcome: estimated points, refined status, key discussion points, and any modifications made to the original scope.

3. **Document Questions Raised**
   Questions that couldn't be answered in the session need owners and due dates. Don't let them disappear—they often block sprint planning.

4. **Capture Decisions Made**
   Record any scope decisions, technical approaches agreed upon, or priority changes. These decisions are valuable context that gets lost without documentation.

5. **Note Action Items**
   Any follow-up work needed before stories are sprint-ready: mockups to create, technical spikes to run, stakeholders to consult.

6. **Flag Blocked Stories**
   Clearly identify stories that can't proceed until blockers are resolved. Include what the blocker is and who owns resolution.

7. **Plan Next Session**
   Note what should be refined next and any preparation needed.

## Output Format

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] All discussed stories have outcomes recorded
- [ ] Open questions have owners assigned
- [ ] Decisions are captured with enough context
- [ ] Blocked stories are clearly flagged
- [ ] Notes are understandable to someone who wasn't there

## Examples

See `references/EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example.
