# Stakeholder Summary

A stakeholder summary documents the people and groups who have interest in or influence over a project, capturing their needs, concerns, and relationships. Effective stakeholder management often determines project success more than technical execution, making this document essential for navigating organizational complexity.

## When to Use

- At the start of a new project or initiative to map the landscape
- When taking over an existing project from another PM
- Before major decision points that require cross-functional buy-in
- When experiencing resistance or misalignment mid-project
- During organizational changes that shift stakeholder dynamics
- When preparing communication strategies for launches or changes

## Instructions

When asked to create a stakeholder summary, follow these steps:

1. **Identify All Stakeholders**
   List everyone with a stake in the project: sponsors, approvers, contributors, consumers of the output, and those affected by changes. Cast a wide net initially—you can prioritize later. Include both individuals and groups.

2. **Assess Influence and Interest**
   For each stakeholder, evaluate their influence (power to affect the project) and interest (how much they care about outcomes). This determines how much attention each requires.

3. **Understand Their Perspective**
   Document what each stakeholder needs from the project, what concerns or risks they perceive, and what a successful outcome looks like to them. When possible, validate these directly through conversation.

4. **Map Relationships**
   Identify key dependencies, alliances, and potential conflicts between stakeholders. Understanding who influences whom helps you navigate organizational dynamics.

5. **Categorize by Engagement Level**
   Based on influence and interest, determine the appropriate engagement approach: actively manage, keep satisfied, keep informed, or monitor. Different stakeholders need different levels of attention.

6. **Plan Communication**
   For high-priority stakeholders, define communication cadence, preferred channels, and key messages. Good stakeholder management is proactive, not reactive.

7. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**
   Note where stakeholder concerns could derail the project and plan how to address them. Early attention to resistant stakeholders prevents surprises.
