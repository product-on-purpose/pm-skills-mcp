# Technical Decisions

## 2026-01-15: Project Initialization

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
New project initialized with agentic coding structure.

**Decision:**
Initialize with standard project structure including README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, and AGENTS context files.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Minimal structure (README only) — Rejected, insufficient for AI continuity
- Full open-source structure (with CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) — Deferred until needed

**Consequences:**
- Consistent structure across all projects
- AI sessions can resume with full context
- May have unused files for simple projects (acceptable tradeoff)
