# Session Log: 2026-01-20 (npm Publish)

## Summary

Published `pm-skills-mcp@0.1.0` to npm after resolving 2FA authentication issues. Also updated the implementation plan to reflect completed status and cleaned up outdated planning documents.

## Key Accomplishments

### npm Publish
- Verified npm login status
- Created granular access token with 2FA bypass on npmjs.com
- Successfully published `pm-skills-mcp@0.1.0` to npm registry
- Package verified live: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm-skills-mcp

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `_NOTES/efforts/plan-v1/mcp-implementation-plan_claude-opus-4.5.md`:
  - Version 1.0 → 1.1, Status: Complete
  - Added completion dates to all 6 phases
  - Updated tool/resource/prompt counts to actuals
  - Replaced "Next Steps" with "Completion Summary" table
  - Added implementation notes explaining deviations from original plan
- Moved planning discussion log to `_NOTES/planning-approach-and-tools_2026-01-16.md`
- Confirmed `.gitignore` is correctly configured (src tracked, dist/node_modules/skills ignored)

## Decisions Made

1. **npm Token**: Used granular access token with "All packages" scope and 2FA bypass for initial publish (new packages can't be scoped to specific package names)

2. **Planning File**: Kept implementation plan as historical record rather than archiving, updated with completion status

## Issues Encountered

1. **npm 2FA requirement**: Initial publish attempts failed due to 2FA. Resolved by creating granular access token with bypass enabled.

2. **OTP vs Token confusion**: Clarified that `--otp` flag expects 6-digit authenticator code, while granular tokens are set via `npm config set`.

3. **Wrong directory**: Initial publish attempt was in pm-skills instead of pm-skills-mcp.

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automate testing on PR, publish on release
2. **Add ESLint/Prettier** - Code quality tooling
3. **Test npx installation** - Verify `npx pm-skills-mcp` works correctly from fresh install

## Next Session Prompt
