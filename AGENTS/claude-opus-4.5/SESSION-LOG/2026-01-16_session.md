# Session Log: 2026-01-16

## Summary

Created comprehensive MCP implementation plan for pm-skills-mcp, analyzed alternative Copilot plan, integrated best ideas from both approaches, wrote professional README, and documented all architectural decisions.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created detailed 6-phase implementation plan**
   - Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
   - Phase 2: Complete Tool Implementation (28 tools)
   - Phase 3: Resources Implementation (75+ resources)
   - Phase 4: Prompts Implementation (6 templates + validation)
   - Phase 5: Configuration & Distribution
   - Phase 6: Testing & QA

2. **Analyzed Copilot alternative plan**
   - Compared discrete tools (our approach) vs. generic tools (Copilot)
   - Identified valuable additions: `pm_search_skills`, `pm_validate`
   - Adopted performance targets and CI/CD specifications
   - Documented rationale for preferring discrete tool approach

3. **Wrote professional README**
   - Value proposition and transformation table
   - Complete tool reference (29 tools)
   - Resource URI documentation
   - Configuration and installation guides
   - Architecture diagram

4. **Approved 4 key architectural decisions**
   - Discrete tools (one per skill) for maximum discoverability
   - Embed skills at build time with optional override
   - Bundle tools return plan, client orchestrates
   - Add search and validate utility tools

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Tool paradigm | 29 discrete tools (not generic) |
| Skill embedding | Build-time with `PM_SKILLS_PATH` override |
| Workflow execution | Stateless; return plan, client orchestrates |
| Utility tools | Add `pm_search_skills` and `pm_validate` |
| Performance targets | < 100ms cached, < 300ms uncached |

## Issues Encountered

None significant. Planning phase completed smoothly.

## Next Session Recommendations

Begin Phase 1 implementation:
1. Initialize project with MCP SDK, TypeScript, Zod
2. Create server scaffold structure
3. Implement skill loader for parsing SKILL.md files
4. Build first sample tool (`pm_prd`) as proof of concept

## Next Session Prompt

```
Continue implementing pm-skills-mcp. The implementation plan is approved and ready at:
_NOTES/efforts/plan-v1/mcp-implementation-plan_claude-opus-4.5.md

Start with Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure:
1. Install dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, gray-matter, zod, typescript)
2. Create the MCP server scaffold (src/index.ts, server.ts, config.ts)
3. Implement the skill loader to parse SKILL.md frontmatter
4. Create the first working tool (pm_prd) as proof of concept

The skills to embed are in E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\skills\
```

## Session Highlights

### Key Prompt: Plan Creation
User requested an MCP implementation plan using pm-skills as the source for 24 PM skills.

### Key Response: Architecture Decision
Chose discrete tools (one per skill) over generic tools because:
- Maximum discoverability (all skills visible in tool list)
- Matches pm-skills slash command experience
- Reduces round-trips (no need to query before invoking)

### Key Insight: Copilot Plan Analysis
The Copilot plan's `search_skills` and `validate_output` tools were valuable additions adopted into our plan, while its generic tool paradigm was rejected in favor of discoverability.
