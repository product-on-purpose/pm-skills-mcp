# Session Log: 2026-01-16 (Evening)

## Summary

Pre-implementation planning session focused on work management approach and resource gathering. Decided on plan file + wrap-session approach for tracking progress, identified key MCP reference materials, and updated the implementation plan accordingly.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Decided on work management approach**
   - Plan file updates when phases complete
   - `/wrap-session` at end of each session for handoff context
   - No GitHub issues (solo project, internal tracking sufficient)

2. **Identified MCP reference materials**
   - Official: TypeScript SDK, Build Server Tutorial, server.md docs
   - Local: `awesome-claude-skills/mcp-builder/reference/` contains excellent guides
     - `node_mcp_server.md` - TypeScript patterns, Zod schemas, tool registration
     - `mcp_best_practices.md` - naming, pagination, error handling, security

3. **Updated implementation plan**
   - Added "Work Management" section documenting our approach
   - Added "Reference Materials" section with links to resources

4. **Exported planning discussion**
   - Created `PLANNING/planning-approach.md` with full conversation

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Work management | Plan file + wrap-session | Solo project, internal tracking sufficient, minimal overhead |
| GitHub issues | Skip unless needed | Overhead for focused implementation sprint |

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Session Recommendations

Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation:
1. Install dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, gray-matter, zod)
2. Create MCP server scaffold (src/index.ts, server.ts, config.ts)
3. Implement skill loader to parse SKILL.md frontmatter
4. Create first working tool (pm_prd) as proof of concept

## Next Session Prompt

```
Continue implementing pm-skills-mcp. The implementation plan is approved at:
_NOTES/efforts/plan-v1/mcp-implementation-plan_claude-opus-4.5.md

Start with Phase 1:
1. Install dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, gray-matter, zod)
2. Create MCP server scaffold (src/index.ts, server.ts, config.ts)
3. Implement skill loader to parse SKILL.md frontmatter
4. Create first working tool (pm_prd) as proof of concept

Skills to embed: E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\skills\

Reference materials:
- awesome-claude-skills/mcp-builder/reference/node_mcp_server.md
- awesome-claude-skills/mcp-builder/reference/mcp_best_practices.md
```

## Session Highlights

### Key Discussion: Work Management Options
Evaluated three approaches:
1. Plan file updates only
2. GitHub issues with labels
3. Hybrid approach

Chose plan file + wrap-session for simplicity given solo project scope.

### Key Finding: Local MCP References
The `awesome-claude-skills/mcp-builder/reference/` folder contains comprehensive TypeScript MCP server implementation guides that cover everything needed for Phase 1.
